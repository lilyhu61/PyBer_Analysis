# PyBer_Challenge_Analysis
## Overview of the analysis
   The purpose of this project is using Python skills and knowledge of Pandas to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. 
   Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib to create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. And report that summarizes 
   how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.
 
## Results
**Attached is a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type and a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type.
By reviewing the summary and graph, the findings are as follows:**
  - The number of rides in the rural citites is about 13 and 5 times lower than urban and suburban cities, respectively.
  - The number of drivers in the rural cities is about 30.8 and 6.3 times lower than urban and suburban cities, respectively.
  - Rural cities have the highest average fare per ride and driver.

## Summary
    Based on the results, I have three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among 
    the city types:
    1. We should increase the number of drivers in rural cities to ensure have enough drivers to meet 
       ridership demand.
    2 .Offer ride sharing drivers in rural cities more support by increasing marketing of PyBer services near 
       local transportation hubs.
    3. PyBer should initiate a 20% fare increase to urban city riders that would put average fares closer 
       to what rural drivers receive.
